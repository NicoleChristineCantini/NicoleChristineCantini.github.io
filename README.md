# Nicole Cantini's Homepage

In this web site you will be able to know me better, I wrote about my *academic life* so far and my *main interests*.
In addition to that, I added some ![**images**](C:\Users\Nicole\Desktop\UniGe\2Â° ANNO\Printemps 2020\TIC\Git\NicoleChristineCantini.github.io\images\avatar.jpg) and ![alt **favicon**](favicon.ico), to let people know who they're reading about.
Moreover, added some link to my personal social media channel such as:
1. Facebook
2. Instagram as well as 
3. my institutional email of the University of Geneva
