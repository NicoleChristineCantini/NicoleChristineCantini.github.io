						<h1>NICOLE CANTINI, 24 y/o </h1>
						
						<p>Born and raised under the Tuscan sun, drinking wine and surrounded by art, Nicole has always been facinated by foreign languages and cultures;
						she therefore graduated in Linguistic and Cultural Mediation at the Università per Stranieri di Siena in 2017.
						It was during her semester abroad at the University of Nürnberg-Erlangen that Nicole discovered her interest in translation and once she came back, she wrote her Bachelor thesis on audiovisual translation.
						Given her mixed Swiss-Italian origins, the good reputation the University of Geneva enjoys and the internationality of the city, the choice of where to continue her studies fell quite naturally on Geneva.
						However, it was during her first year of Master of Arts in Translation and Specialised Multilingual Communication that she realized how extremely interesting the field of translation technologies was and
						she ended up changing her mind and applying for the Master in Mutililingual Communication Technology in the same university, where she is currently studying.

						<h2>LOCALISATION</h2>
						
						<p>Hereby I would like to introduce you some of the content presented and learned during the Localisation course I attended on the autumn semester 2019.
						Among other things, I learned the basis of image, web, software, game and mobile localisation as well as a brief introduction to programming and open source localisation.
						The following Webpage is structured as follows: you will find a section for each of the abovementioned subjects, all you have to do is to click on the one of your interest to discover more about it.
						For each section there is not only a summary of the course content, but also a part explaining what we have done in each week's lab supported by some images.
						Last but not least, I added some personal comments on my learning experience for each subfield.
						<br/>So, what are you waiting for? Let's begin!</p>
