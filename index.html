						<h1>NICOLE CANTINI, 24 y/o </h1>
						
						<p>Born and raised under the Tuscan sun, drinking wine and surrounded by art, Nicole has always been facinated by foreign languages and cultures;
						she therefore graduated in Linguistic and Cultural Mediation at the Università per Stranieri di Siena in 2017.
						It was during her semester abroad at the University of Nürnberg-Erlangen that Nicole discovered her interest in translation and once she came back, she wrote her Bachelor thesis on audiovisual translation.
						Given her mixed Swiss-Italian origins, the good reputation the University of Geneva enjoys and the internationality of the city, the choice of where to continue her studies fell quite naturally on Geneva.
						However, it was during her first year of Master of Arts in Translation and Specialised Multilingual Communication that she realized how extremely interesting the field of translation technologies was and
						she ended up changing her mind and applying for the Master in Mutililingual Communication Technology in the same university, where she is currently studying.
						</p>
						
						<p>Outside of academic life, her interests span several fields; in September she approaches aerial dances, a discipline that has always fascinated her and that once tried she cannot do without.
						Although she loves being surrounded by her friends, sometimes she needs to make time for herself and spend the evening with a good book or movie. </p>
